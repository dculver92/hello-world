# hello-world
Creating my first repository

I'm a recent biomedical engineer graduate looking to branch into the world of software development. I have some (very little) experience with C++ and Java from my undergrad studies, but I am looking to develop general programming skills. My main focus is on Python at the moment, and I would like to branch into Ruby on Rails.
